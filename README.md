Thoughts: Going to attempt this project in a 3-step process. First, I'm going to lay out the grid. Second, I'm going to add the hover effect and finally I would set up the user input that would allow an arbritary A x A grid where A is the user input.

Part one: Setting up the grid was smooth, though you have to create a new div for each individual grid square (thought you could get away with just creating one and appending x amount of times to save time). Initially flexed the body but you should be able to just flex the main container if the dimensions are set to the webpage.
